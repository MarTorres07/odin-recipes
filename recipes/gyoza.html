<h1>Gyoza</h1>
<img src="images/gyoza.jpg" alt="a picture of gyozas">
<p>Gyoza originates from the Chinese dumplings called Jiaozi. You fill these dumplings with minced meat and a variety of vegetables and then roll them in dough. These can then be steamed, fried, or even deep-fried. However, the Japanese Gyoza consists of the same filling but the cooking method is slightly different. You pan fry the goyza until the bottom is deliciously golden brown and then steam until it is tender in the middle.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>

    <li> 300 g ground chicken </li>
    <li> 100 g Napa cabbage</li>
    <li> 1 package Gyoza wrappers</li>
    <li> 10 g scallion (spring onions)</li>
    <li> 1 clove garlic grated </li>
    <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce </li>
    <li> 1 tbsp sake </li> 
    <li> 1/2 tbsp mirin </li>
    <li> 1 tbsp salt </li>
    
</ul>

<h3> Steps: </h3>
<ol>

    <li> Finely slice the Chinese cabbage and place in abowl. Add salt and mix together. Leave this to sit for 5 minutes. 
        The salt willdraw out the moisture from the cabbage. After 5 minutes has passed, using yourhands, squeeze out any remaining water from the cabbage. Prepare the otheringredients in separate bowls for easy management.</li>
    <li> Mix the ground chicken, Chinese cabbage, scallions, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and grated garlic in a bowl.</li>
    <li> Place a gyoza wrapper in your weaker hand. With one finger, add a little water to the edge of one side of the gyoza. This willhelp with binding it together. Place 1 tbsp of filling in the center. Do not put too much as it will be hard to wrap the gyoza!</li>
    <li>Fold the gyoza in half. Then with your strongerhand, use your thumb and index finger to make small pleats along the edge ofone side of the gyoza. Aim for around 4 to 5 for one gyoza. Push the two sidesof the gyoza together as you make each pleat to help seal it tightly. Shape thegyoza so they are slightly curved.</li>
    <li> Heat your pan to a medium heat. Add a neutral oil and then add your gyoza with the flat side down. Fry until light brown on the bottom. Add 50ml water (about 1/4 cup) in thepan and cover with a lid. Wait till the water has mostly evaporated. This may take around 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> Take off the lid (if there is any remaining water, keep cooking until it is 100% evaporated. Serve and enjoy!</li>
